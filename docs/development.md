# Development

How to build Max Video Player from source, run it, and test it. For how the code fits
together, see [architecture.md](architecture.md). For cutting a release, see
[releasing.md](releasing.md).

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) 1.90 or later, from the stable channel
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 24, or 22.22.1 or a later 22.x release
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation). With Node 24, `corepack enable pnpm` sets it
  up. pnpm 10 or later switches itself to the version that `package.json` names.
- The platform dependencies below

The desktop app builds on macOS (Apple Silicon) and Linux (x86_64). Windows isn't
supported yet. For the iPhone and iPad app, see [ios.md](ios.md).

### macOS

Homebrew's `mpv` is built for Vulkan only, and the embedded player needs OpenGL, so
libmpv is built from source:

```bash
# ffmpeg@7, because mpv 0.40 uses APIs that ffmpeg 8 removed
brew install meson ninja pkg-config ffmpeg@7 libass libplacebo dylibbundler
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$(brew --prefix ffmpeg@7)/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"

./scripts/build-libmpv.sh macos
```

The script clones mpv into `libs/mpv-src/` and writes `libs/macos/libmpv.dylib`. The
first run takes a few minutes; later runs reuse the clone.

### Linux (Ubuntu and Debian)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  libmpv-dev libegl-dev \
  libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
  libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev libsoup-3.0-dev \
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
  libssl-dev pkg-config librsvg2-dev \
  patchelf
```

The system `libmpv-dev` is enough for development. To build libmpv from source
instead, as the AppImage does:

```bash
sudo apt-get install meson ninja-build \
  libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libavfilter-dev \
  libass-dev libdrm-dev

./scripts/build-libmpv.sh linux
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(pwd)/libs/linux:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

### The ffmpeg sidecar

Offline downloads run a bundled `ffmpeg` binary, and Tauri won't build the app until
it exists. Fetch it once:

```bash
./scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.sh
```

It downloads a static ffmpeg to `apps/desktop/src-tauri/binaries/` as
`max-video-player-ffmpeg-<target>`, where the target is your Rust target triple. The
Linux packages install it in `/usr/bin`, so it has its own name rather than `ffmpeg`.
If your `binaries/` folder still has an older `ffmpeg-<target>`, run the script again.

## Running the app

```bash
pnpm install

# macOS: point the binary at the libmpv you built
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(pwd)/libs/macos:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"

pnpm dev:desktop
```

This starts Vite and the Tauri app with hot reload for the frontend. Rust changes
rebuild and restart the app.

`pnpm dev:desktop:web` runs only the frontend in a browser. Anything that calls
the Rust backend won't work there, but it's quick for layout work.

`pnpm install` doesn't run dependencies' install scripts. If a new dependency has one,
the install stops until the package is listed under `allowBuilds` in
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, with `true` to run its script or `false` to skip it.

If you installed the packages with npm before the switch to pnpm, delete
`node_modules` and `apps/desktop/node_modules` before the first `pnpm install`.
pnpm doesn't remove the packages that npm put at the top level of
`node_modules`, and they can hide a missing dependency that CI then catches.

## Tests and checks

```bash
pnpm test                 # Rust core tests, then frontend tests
pnpm test:core            # cargo test -p mvp-core
pnpm test:desktop         # Vitest
pnpm lint                 # ESLint
pnpm format:check         # Prettier
cargo check               # the whole Rust workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

For a frontend coverage report, run `pnpm --filter ./apps/desktop test:coverage`
and open `apps/desktop/coverage/index.html`.

Rust coverage needs [cargo-llvm-cov](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov) and
LLVM's tools. Install them once:

```bash
rustup component add llvm-tools
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov --locked
```

Then run the tests and open the report:

```bash
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --open
```

The plugin and app tests load libmpv, so set the library path from the setup steps
above first. The app's tests also need the [ffmpeg sidecar](#the-ffmpeg-sidecar)
and a built frontend in `apps/desktop/dist`, which `pnpm build:desktop` makes.
The Rust figure depends on the platform, because `macos.rs` and `linux.rs` in the
mpv plugin each build only on their own system.

CI publishes the [frontend report](https://MaxMB15.github.io/MaxVideoPlayer/coverage/)
and the [Rust report](https://MaxMB15.github.io/MaxVideoPlayer/coverage/rust/) for
`main` to GitHub Pages. Both come from Linux runs.

CI runs Clippy with warnings as errors on macOS, on Linux and for the iOS simulator,
so each platform's own code is checked. The Linux job also fails when Rust line
coverage drops below 80%. CI uses the latest stable Rust, so a new release can add a
lint that fails code nobody changed. Run `rustup update stable` to see the same lints
locally.

A Husky pre-commit hook runs Prettier and ESLint on the staged files through
lint-staged, then runs the tests.

## Production build

```bash
cd apps/desktop && pnpm tauri build
```

On macOS, `scripts/bundle-libmpv.sh` runs as Tauri's `beforeBundleCommand`. It copies
libmpv and its Homebrew dependencies into the app with `dylibbundler`, removes
duplicate `LC_RPATH` entries, and fails if any bundled library needs a newer macOS
than `minimumSystemVersion`. A local build uses your Mac's Homebrew libraries, so it
may only run on your macOS version; release builds run on a macOS 15 runner.

On Linux, `scripts/bundle-libmpv-linux.sh` copies `libmpv.so` and its dependencies
into the AppImage. The `.deb` and `.rpm` declare libmpv as a package dependency
instead.

The `.deb` and `.rpm` also require WebKitGTK 2.40 or later, the first version that
supports all the CSS in the app's styles. Tailwind 4's breakpoints like `sm:` use
range media queries such as `(width >= 40rem)`, which WebKitGTK 2.38 ignores, and
2.40 is also the first to turn on `@property` and the `lh` unit. Tauri copies each `rpm.depends`
entry into the package as a bare name, so the `.rpm` gives the version inside an
RPM boolean dependency, `(webkit2gtk4.1 >= 2.40)`. The AppImage bundles the
WebKitGTK of the machine that built it.

The output lands in `target/release/bundle/`. To sign the macOS build with a
Developer ID, see [macos-signing.md](macos-signing.md).

## Code style

- TypeScript and React use arrow functions everywhere, never `function`
  declarations. `export default function` is the one exception.
- Prettier formats `apps/**`; run `pnpm format`.
- All `invoke()` calls to the Rust backend live in `apps/desktop/src/lib/tauri.ts`.
- On macOS, AppKit and OpenGL calls must run on the main thread. See
  [architecture.md](architecture.md#macos).

## Branches and pull requests

- Branch from `dev` and open pull requests against `dev`. `main` only receives `dev`
  when a release is cut.
- Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org):
  `feat:`, `fix(linux):`, `ci:`, `docs:` and so on.
- CI builds macOS and Linux on pull requests that touch platform code, and runs the
  tests on every pull request.

## Continuous integration

| Workflow | Runs on | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Build & Bundle](../.github/workflows/build.yml) | Pushes and pull requests to `main`, `dev` and `release-*`; manual runs | Lint, Clippy, formatting, tests, coverage, and macOS and Linux builds uploaded as artifacts. Rust line coverage below 80% fails the Linux job. Pull requests build only the platforms their changes affect. The `ci-status` job fails when any other job failed or was cancelled. A manual run builds a signed macOS app. |
| [iOS](../.github/workflows/ios.yml) | Pushes and pull requests to `main` and `dev` that touch the app | A debug build for the iOS simulator, and Clippy for the iOS target |
| [iOS TestFlight](../.github/workflows/ios-testflight.yml) | Manual | Builds the iOS app for devices and uploads it to TestFlight. See [ios.md](ios.md). |
| [Release](../.github/workflows/release.yml) | Tags `v*` | Builds and uploads the release. See [releasing.md](releasing.md). |
| [Release — one-click pipeline](../.github/workflows/release-pipeline.yml) | Manual | Merges `dev` into `main`, bumps the version and pushes the tag. |
| [Release — bump version (PR)](../.github/workflows/release-bump.yml), [Release — push tag](../.github/workflows/release-tag.yml) | Manual | The same release in two steps, for when `main` requires pull requests. |

The workflows pin each action to a commit, with its version in a comment. Dependabot
opens pull requests against `dev` each week for npm packages, crates and actions,
once a release is a week old. Minor and patch updates come grouped by ecosystem, and
each major update comes alone. Tauri is the exception. Its npm packages and its crates
each come in one pull request, majors included, and the Tauri CLI won't build while
the two differ by a minor version. Combine the two into one pull request before
merging. Dependabot reads [`dependabot.yml`](../.github/dependabot.yml) from `main`,
so a change to it takes effect after the next release.
